        ### Privacy Note  


        SocksAI is designed to be **privacy-friendly** and respects your data. Since this project was primarily built for exploratory purposes, I have not focused on a full-scale deployment. However, I still wanted to make it available to end users. This is why SocksAI requires you to provide your own API keys. That said, I have ensured that **your API keys, personal information, and trading data are never stored anywhere** with me.  


        #### 🔒 How SocksAI Handles Your Data  
        - **No data is stored** - Everything runs either **locally on your device** or through the **API services you provide**.  
        - **API keys are never saved** - They are only used during the session and not logged or retained.  
        - **No third-party tracking** - SocksAI does not send your data anywhere.  

        #### 🔍 Open-Source & Transparent  
        - SocksAI is **open-source**, meaning you can check the entire codebase on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sameetpatil5).  
        - If you're concerned about privacy, you're free to **review the code yourself** and confirm that nothing is stored or misused.  

        #### ✅ Your Data, Your Control  
        - Since SocksAI does not store anything, **your data stays with you**.  
        - If you're using an API, it only connects when you run the app and does not save anything after you close it.  

        I've built SocksAI with a lot of passion and effort, and I'm committed to keeping it safe and secure. I understand the importance of privacy, so you can use it with confidence, knowing that **your information is safe and always under your control**. 🚀
